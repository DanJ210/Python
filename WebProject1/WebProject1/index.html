		<p>We offer the highest can prices in town, call for pricing. We accept and buy all metals, anything metal.
		We have loads of vintage antique metals which can be purchased, some are one of a kind hand crafted makes
		and some are just unique. The plus here is that we also have many parts laying around that could be used to
		fix up around the house. Roofing, paneling, sometimes brand new gutters, new and used <em>ladders</em>, <em>bicycles</em> for
		parts usually, plenty of appliances and plugs for charging phones, computers and other various devices, and
		various size and strengths of extension cords... and much much more. Come take a look and see what being an
		american picker can really feel like!</p>

				Now buying <strong>E-Scrap!!!</strong> E-Scrap comes from computers
			 	no matter how old. We take buy desktop and laptops as a whole or if taken apart and 					
			 	seperated. We pay top dollar for processors, RAM, Hard Drives, Motherboards,
				Power Supplies, PCI cards, Fan(Electric Motors) and the drives. You can remove the
				aluminum heat sinks but leave the tiny copper transformers. Even
				the battery can be removed. As leaving those elements will interfere
				with the extraction process.

				 <strong><span class="auto-style1">O</span></strong>ur basket program is mainly for schools and churches and other
				business just like that, even boy scouts or girl scouts. We deliver
				a large sized basket to leave on the property of the business and
				once it is filled, we will come pick it up. We take it back to sort
				and weight the amount and a check is paid out to the business who
				provided them. It helps everyone especially the kids learn about
				recycling and keeping the environment clean. Great way to raise some
				funds for extra curricular activities.
